Developers who need to consume the published APIs must include a valid subscription key in HTTP requests when they make calls to those APIs. Otherwise, the calls are rejected immediately by the API Management gateway. They aren't forwarded to the back-end services.</p>\n<p>To get a subscription key for accessing APIs, a subscription is required. A subscription is essentially a named container for a pair of subscription keys. Developers who need to consume the published APIs can get subscriptions. And they don't need approval from API publishers. API publishers can also create subscriptions directly for API consumers.</p>\n<div class=\"alert is-success\">\n<p class=\"alert-title\"><span class=\"docon docon-lightbulb\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span> Tip</p>\n<p>API Management also supports other mechanisms for securing access to APIs, including the following examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"api-management-howto-protect-backend-with-aad\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">OAuth2.0</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"api-management-howto-mutual-certificates-for-clients\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Client certificates</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-access-restriction-policies#RestrictCallerIPs\" data-linktype=\"external\">IP whitelisting</a></li></ul></div>",

Any debugging can take place without involving your production cloud environment or provisioning additional (potentially costly) test resources in the cloud. This is also more efficient for your developers.</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned above, Functions also offer more flexibility due to their basis in powerful programming languages. They are also portable into and out of Azure. Some common scenarios for using Functions include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Timer-based triggers</li>\n\t<li>Azure service event processing</li>\n\t<li>SaaS event prcessing</li>\n\t<li>Serverless web app and mobile app architecture</li>\n\t<li>Real-time stream processing or bot messaging</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Logic Apps are preferable when you don’t wish to leverage developer resources and instead use the GUI. They are better suited to integrations as many connectors are available out of the box. Therefore Logic Apps can reduce your time to market in an automation scenario. Some common uses for Logic Apps include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>SaaS event processing</li>\n\t<li>Timer-based or content-based triggers and routing</li>\n\t<li>Data ingestion or transformation</li>\n\t<li>Business Processes</li>\n\t<li>Integration between Azure cloud services</li></ul>",

The following scenarios describe common uses for slots:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Different environments for different purposes</strong>: Using different slots gives you the opportunity to differentiate app instances before swapping to production or a staging slot.</li>\n<li><strong>Prewarming</strong>: Deploying to a slot instead of directly to production allows the app to warm up before going live. Additionally, using slots reduces latency for HTTP-triggered workloads. Instances are warmed up before deployment which reduces the cold start for newly-deployed functions.</li>\n<li><strong>Easy fallbacks</strong>: After a swap with production, the slot with a previously staged app now has the previous production app. If the changes swapped into the production slot aren't as you expect, you can immediately reverse the swap to get your \"last known good instance\" back.</li></ul>",
